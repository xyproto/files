# bin

Go module and command line utility for checking if the given file is likely to be binary or text.

It does so by reading the first, middle and last 24 bytes of the file and trying to convert the data to utf8.

If one of the 24 byte blocks can not be converted, it's considered to be a binary file.

Also, if one of the blocks have more than 33% zero bytes, it's considered to be a binary file.

If the file is empty, it's decided to be a text file.

## Installing the utility

With Go 1.17 or later:

    go install github.com/xyproto/binary/cmd/binary@latest

## Example use

* `binary /usr/bin/ls` returns `binary`.
* `binary /etc/fstab` returns `text`.

## Using the Go module

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "github.com/xyproto/binary"
)

func main() {
    filename := os.Args[0]
    isBinary, err := binary.File(filename)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%s\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    fmt.Printf("%s is a binary file: %v\n", filename, isBinary)
}
```
